# From-A-Database-To-PowerBI

I have included the Power BI project in this repository which is the finished product from the process document. The querying in the repository  'sTunes-Custom-SQL-Querying'  helped me create the dashboards. I focused on genre in particular, because genre gives a sense of the "taste" or "spirit" of a nation or region. I wanted to understand the vibe, so to speak. I am also a music fan.  

The steepest learning challenge has been a clearer grasp of DAX. I have been studying 'The Definitive Guide to DAX', by Marco Russo and Alberto Ferrari. This learning manual is thick, and reading it takes patience, but it is a useful resource to understand how DAX works. Understanding how DAX works is the key, as Russo and Ferrari highlight periodically. 

While DAX is useful for data tranformations, please don't underestimate the power of Power Query (no pun intended). Power Query is a wonderful tool too.
