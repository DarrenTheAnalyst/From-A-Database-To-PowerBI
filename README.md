# From-A-Database-To-PowerBI

I have included the Power BI project in this repository which is the finished product from the process document.

The steepest learning challenge has been a clearer grasp of DAX. I have been studying 'The Definitive Guide to DAX', by Marco Russo and Alberto Ferrari. This learning manual is thick, but it is a useful resource to understand how DAX works.

While DAX is useful for data tranformations, please don't underestimate the power of Power Query (no pun intended). Power Query is a wonderful tool.
